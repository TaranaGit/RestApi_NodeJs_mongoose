# Fullstack NodeJs Project

This project is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB with Mongoose for the database. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tracking exercise routines.

# Features
* CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on exercise routines.
* Concurrent Frontend and Backend: The application runs both the frontend and backend concurrently.
* Form for Data Input: There is a form in the frontend that allows users to input exercise details such as title/name, load in kg, and repetitions.
* Data Storage: Exercise data entered through the form is stored in the MongoDB database.

# Technologies Used
* Frontend:
- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Used for styling and design.
